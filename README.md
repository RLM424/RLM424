- ⚡ Fun fact: Most maps of the world are wrong. On most maps, the Mercator projection – first developed in 1569 – is still used. 
This method is wildly inaccurate and makes Alaska appear as large as Brazil and Greenland 14 times larger than it actually is. 
For a map to be completely accurate, it would need to be life-size and round, not flat.
